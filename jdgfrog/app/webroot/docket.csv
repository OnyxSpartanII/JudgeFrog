Veerpol was able to obtain a visitor’s visa for at least one of the victims through her husband’s contacts at the Thai embassy. Once in the United States, the defendant forced the victims to work long hours performing housework and childcare. Defendant opened bank and credit card accounts in the victims’ names, which she used for her own benefit. Veerpol used threats of legal action, verbal abuse, and physical violence to maintain control over the workers. At one point, the defendant threatened to kill one of the workers if she returned to Thailand.  In addition to confiscating the victim’s passports, the defendant further isolated the women by prohibiting them from using the mail or telephone, and by denying them access to Thai-language newspapers. The victims were not permitted to speak to defendant’s house guests. The defendant permitted one victim to return to Thailand, after a Thai consular official intervened at the request of the victim’s siblings.
